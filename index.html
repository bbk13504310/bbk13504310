    <h2>About me, sort of!</h2>

    <p>I'm a second year undergraduate student of Japanese language and journalism. I like all the things you'd expect me to like considering what I'm studying! The anime, the news, that's the stuff.</p>
    <p>I also like biscuits, but there wasn't a degree course for that.</p> 
    <p>Contrary to the name given above, I'm not a cold, unfeeling robot christened with a serial number for a name. I just don't want to put my DATA here and have to spend the rest of my life scrubbing it off the Internet after an <b>actual</b> robot crawls over this page like an ant on an apple.</p>
    <p>I live with my girlfriend and my cat. It's a pretty good life. Especially when there are biscuits.</p>

    
    <p>I guess I'll follow this low quality introduction up with some <b>high quality Internet</b>.
    </p>
    

    <h2>The good stuff:</h2>
