    <h2>The information you require:</h2>

    <p>I'm a second year undergraduate student of Japanese language and journalism. I'm into all the things you'd expect considering my studies: the anime, the games, the news. That's the content that leaves me content.</p>
    
    <p>I also like biscuits, but there wasn't a degree course for those...</p>
    
    <p>Sorry for the lack of detailed PII, but I work in a field with a <i>real stalky</i> lil' userbase and tend to avoid dropping my details online as a habit.</p>
    
    <p>Here's what I can tell you. I live with my girlfriend and our cat. It's pretty good, <i>especially</i> when we have biscuits.</p>
    
    <p>I'm really excited to study with everyone during this course and look forward to using what we'll learn together to create something neat for the final assignment that will probably be related to anime, games or the news.</p>
    
    <p>I guess I'll contrast this low quality introduction with some <b>high quality links</b>.
