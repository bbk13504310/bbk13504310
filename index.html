    <h2>About me</h2>

    <p>I'm a second year undergraduate student of Japanese language and journalism. I like all the things you'd expect me to like considering what I'm studying! The anime, the news, that's the stuff. I also like biscuits, but there wasn't a degree course for that. Contrary to the name given above, I'm not a cold, unfeeling robot christened with a serial number for a name. I just don't want to use my actual name here and have to spend a decade trying to scrub it off the Internet after an <b>actual</b> robot has crawled over this page like an ant on an apple. I live with my girlfriend and my cat. It's a good life.
    </p>   
    
    <p>There's not a lot I can really think to write right now, so I guess I'll end this with some quality Internet.
    </p>
    

    <h2>Some of that Good Internet:</h2>
