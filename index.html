    <h2>The information you require:</h2>

    <p>I'm a second year undergraduate student of Japanese language and journalism. I like all the things you'd expect me to like considering what I'm studying! The anime, the news, that's the stuff.</p>
    <p>I also like biscuits, but there wasn't a degree course for that.</p> 
    <p>I live with my girlfriend and my cat. It's a pretty good life. Especially when there are biscuits.</p>
    <p>I'm really excited to study digital media design with everyone during this course and look forward to using what we'll learn to create a functional app or website for the final assignment.</p>
    
    <p>I guess I'll follow this low quality introduction with some <b>high quality links</b>.
